Being a gaming fan, The GTA 6 trailer was amazing the animation and computer graphic was so good that this got me thinking, how is it possible to render each strand of hair such that it flows over a persons shoulder or even reacts to wind being blown. Just amazing!! This inspired a wave of curiosity in me, and made me think about computer graphics a topic  that is often over-looked by native software developers such as myself. In this post I’ll be going over simple raytracing, along with lighting, shadows and reflections with the implementations as well.

The idea for ray tracing was consieved in the 16th century Albrecht Dürer where he describes multiple ways of projecting 3-D objects onto a 2-D screen, this is what we are trying to accomplish in this tutorial.
